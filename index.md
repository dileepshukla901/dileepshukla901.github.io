<div class="intro" markdown="1">
I'm a Lead Machine Learning Engineer providing consultancy for data-driven business solutions and managing end-to-end machine learning projects. I design and build data visualization, train, test & deploy ML & AI models for complex business problems across cloud and in-house infrastructures, utilizing both microservice and monolithic architectures.

In my previous role as a Lead ML Engineer at [Sprinklr](https://www.sprinklr.com/), I led a team of engineers and data scientists, focusing on Voice AI services such as TTS, ASR and Voice Analytics. Additionally, I worked on Reinforcement Learning problems for real time ads dynamic content optimizations, text-based models for insights, classification, and NER tasks, delivering impactful solutions that addressed critical business needs.
